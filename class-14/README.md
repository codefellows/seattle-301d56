========================================================

## Overview
Modern front end application logic is designed to be as modular as possible.  This should also be present within the stylistic layer.  SASS (more often implemented as SCSS) is a mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language that gives us that flexibility and more.  With SCSS/SASS you can:

* Create modular CSS components, known as "partials"
* Nest your styles, much like the way HTML is nested/composed
* Import/Export your CSS files
* Create functional CSS components and "mixins"
* Use a large array of math operators

## Learning Objectives
**Students will be able to ...**
* use SCSS to create component based and modular CSS styles
* conform to the SMACCS principles for creating base and layout files for their application styles
* understand the process of refactoring a component based frontend for additional flexibility and re-usablity within components
