## Overview

The four labs in this folder should be completed independently prior to the first Code 301 lecture.

Each assignment has a corresponding Canvas assignment. Make sure to complete each lab and submit the assignment so your TA can grade your work. Ask your instructor or a TA if you have any questions.
